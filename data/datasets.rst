tmQM (transition metal compounds)
---------------------------------

See `The tmQM Dataset - Quantum Geometries and Properties of 86k Transition Metal Complexes <https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv.12894818>`_.

A dataset comprised of 86k transition metal-organic compunds which is freely availabe at 
`Quantum-Machine.org <http://quantum-machine.org/datasets/>`_.
The geometry and composition of each component are listed in using the .xyz file format,
and a number of computed properties are listed in an accompanying .csv file.

This dataset was initially considered for initial tests, however the properties investigated by the authors cannot be computed using a molecular dynamics apporach, thus a different dataset had to be chosen.


Materials Project
-----------------

`MaterialsProject.org <https://materialsproject.org/>`_ has a large collection of materials (structures and computed properties) that can conveniently be accessed using a python client for the `MP API <https://materialsproject.org/api#documentation>`_.
